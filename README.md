# Introduction
This is a simple dashboard with minimal interactivity to uncover some curious facts of the Nobel Prize history :electron: using the [Nobel Prize dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imdevskp/nobel-prize) from Kaggle, which I corrected using Wikipedia information about missing dates of birth.  

### Questions
I wanted to know the following facts about the history of Nobel laureates:
* What are the top countries with most laureates?
* What is the geographical distribution of Nobel laureates?
* What are the affiliations with most Nobel laureates?
* How is the Prize distributed by gender?
* Do native are awarded the Prize more than immigrants?
* What is the age distribution of Nobel laureates (at the time they were awarded the prize)?
